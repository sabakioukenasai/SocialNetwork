/**
 * <p>A package includes different implementations of {@code person}. 
 * A {@code person} represents a node in the graph. </p>
 * 
 * <p>To simulate a social network, we just focus on a <i>person</i>'s name and other people he knows.</p>
 * 
 * <p>We have two different implementations of <i>person</i>. 
 * {@code PersonA} knows knows everybody he/she knows. 
 * While {@code PersonB} only knows himself. 
 * These two different implementations also give rise to different graph implementations</p>
