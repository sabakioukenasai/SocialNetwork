/**
 * A package includes different implementations of graphs. 
 * A node in the graph represents a person
 * 
 * <p>We abstract social relationships in the form of graphs. 
 * Now we are using the form of an undirected graph, 
 * but it may be extended to a directed graph in the future</p>
 * 
 * <p>According to the two implementations of Person, we also 
 * implement two different friendshipGraph classes - respectively 
 * adapting the implementation of the two Person classes. We think 
 * of Person as the points in the graph, they are the basic elements 
 * of the graph. Here's how our different implementations of the 
 * same "basic element" affect our overall design.</p>
